# Base-2-Toolbox-A-Python-Implementation-of-Binary-Arithmetic-and-Conversion

This Python library provides a set of tools for working with binary numbers, including a binary calculator and a text-to-binary converter. The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on binary numbers, while the converter can convert text to binary and binary numbers to different bases (2, 8, 10, and 16).

The library is designed to be easy to use and customizable, with clear, well-commented code that can be easily modified to fit your specific needs. The binary calculator function takes in two binary numbers and an operator, and returns the result in binary format. The text-to-binary converter function takes in a string of text and returns the binary representation of that text. The binary-to-base converter function takes in a binary number and a base, and returns the number in the specified base.

This library is a useful tool for anyone who works with binary numbers, from students learning about computer science to professionals working in fields like data analysis or cryptography. With its simple yet powerful functionality, this library can help you work more efficiently and effectively with binary numbers.
